## Security Features
- **Password Hashing**: Uses `werkzeug.security` for securely hashing passwords.
- **CSRF Protection**: Flask-WTF provides CSRF protection (ensure forms are built using Flask-WTF for this).
- **Secure Sessions**: Flask-Login manages user sessions.
- **Input Validation**: Basic validation for forms is present.
- **Admin-Only Access**: `@admin_required` decorator protects administrative routes.
- **ID Card Verification**: Manual verification step by admins for new voters.
- **Blockchain Immutability**: Votes recorded on the blockchain are tamper-proof.
- **Time-Bound Elections**: Elections are only accessible for voting within their specified start and end times, synchronized with NTP.

## Deployment
This application is deployed on **Render.com**. Key considerations for deployment:
- Use Gunicorn as the WSGI server for production.
- Configure environment variables (like `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`, `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`, `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`) on the Render platform.
- Ensure the `static/id_cards` directory is writable or use a cloud storage solution for uploads in production.
- For a production environment, consider migrating from SQLite to a more robust database like PostgreSQL, which Render supports.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with IPFS for decentralized storage of ID cards.
- Enhanced UI/UX with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js).
- More sophisticated vote encryption techniques before sending to the smart contract.
- Automated ID verification using OCR/AI.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for admin accounts.
- Comprehensive API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI).
- Email notifications for registration approval, election start/end, etc.
